* **Rental Management:** Track scooter rentals, including starting and ending times, user details, and scooter information.
* **Authentication:** Secure user authentication for both administrators and regular users.
* **Database Integration:** Utilizes MongoDB for storing application data.
* **API Endpoints:** RESTful API built with Node.js and Express for backend operations.
* **User Interface:** Responsive and user-friendly interface built with React.
* [Potentially other features like mapping, payment integration, etc. - feel free to add more if applicable]

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the E-Scooter Management System running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >= 16 recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (you'll need a running MongoDB instance)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Munna-Scripts/E-Scooter.git](https://github.com/Munna-Scripts/E-Scooter.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd E-Scooter
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure your environment variables. At a minimum, you'll likely need:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=your_backend_port (e.g., 5000)
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_jwt_key
    # Add any other necessary environment variables
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string`, `your_backend_port`, and `your_secret_jwt_key` with your actual values.
4.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    npm run dev # If there's a dev script defined in package.json
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on the specified port.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and configure your environment variables. You might need to specify the backend API URL:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Or your backend API URL
    ```
4.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will usually open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address).

## Usage

[Provide a brief overview of how to use the application. You can describe the different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and their functionalities. You might want to include screenshots or short descriptions of key pages.]

For example:

* **Admin User:** Can log in to access the admin dashboard, where they can manage scooters, users, and rentals.
* **Regular User:** Can register, log in, view available scooters, initiate rentals, and manage their profile.

[Consider adding more specific usage instructions for key features if needed.]
